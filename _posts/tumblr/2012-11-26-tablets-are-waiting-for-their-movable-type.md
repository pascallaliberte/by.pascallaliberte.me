Ryan Singer:

> Remember the web before Movable Type? If you wanted a blog you had to program one.  
> Apps like Marco Arment’s The Magazine give me flashbacks to that time. Wouldn’t it be awesome to publish my own magazine on the iOS Newsstand?  
> Now is a great time for another Movable Type. Writers would love a way to push serialized content straight to tablets, and the experience would be a boon to readers.
