<p>I briefly tried a Nexus One yesterday and had some of the same conclusions, especially about questioning the usefulness of the track ball.  While <a href="http://twitter.com/pascallaliberte/status/14811965607">I thought the screen was sharp</a>, I haven&#8217;t used the Nexus One outside, as the author has.</p>
<p>My overall impression of the Android OS and the Nexus One is that its design lacks leadership.  For example, someone in the android design world didn&#8217;t have the balls to demand to know why the track ball needed to be on the device, to require that the track ball win its place, to demonstrate its undeniable purpose.  It could have been a backwards compatibility issue, or that some part of the software needs it (like positioning the cursor when writing text), but it still demonstrates an opportunity to root further for the user, to push harder, to focus on the essentials.  It comes down to a leadership issue.</p>
