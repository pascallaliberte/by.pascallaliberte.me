> Peaceful serenity, unceasing white blanket stretching out as far as the eye can see. Graceful curtain powdering the horizon, you bring me happiness. A nuisance? Not to me. Never to me. You cover the grey and the dying with innocence and purity, almost as if in loving forgiveness. How can one hate that which flutters down so gently and unhurried, caressing and resting on the thinnest branches or children&#8217;s eyelashes? You bring brightness and tranquility to both day and night, reflecting sunshine and starlight, and the very essence of my soul&#8230;
