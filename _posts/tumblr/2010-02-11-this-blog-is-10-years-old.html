<p>Ten years ago, I dreamed up a design for a personal site.  It would have had my resume, my contact information, a news portion where I would add my thoughts and a sort of experimental section where I&#8217;d try out php and mysql code I&#8217;d work on.</p>
<p>Of course, I wasn&#8217;t the first one to think of the idea of having that kind of site, after all, there have been blogs around for 11 years or so now, but in a way I feel like I was onto something back then.</p>
<p>And yet, I just got my blog started.  So I&#8217;m late in the game for a guy who has been making websites for 13 years.</p>
<p>Prior to this blog, the following has been my footprint on the web:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.uottawa.ca/">University of Ottawa</a> &#8212; Where I currently work.  I do web stuff there: support web systems for other webmasters, do front-end coding on top-level pages and developed the templates used by the 90+ website owners.</li>
