<p>It was in grade 5, I&#8217;m pretty sure.  I built it out of white cardboard, with a foot-long antenna sticking out, a part I took from a broken walkie-talkie.  On the front surface was a full dial pad I drew in pencil, a rounded-corner outline for the screen and another outline for the camera.  There must have been some extra buttons I can&#8217;t remember, and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if there was a button on the side, because my conception of a video phone was, well, influenced by my time.  You see, my Dad, back then, had two handheld <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens'_band_radio">CBs</a>. I brought it to school and it amused my visual arts teacher who made fun of it, shifting it from his ear to his arm length and back again.  Clearly he didn&#8217;t get it, I thought.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/facetime.html">news of a front-facing-camera iPhone 4</a> wasn&#8217;t a secret for most of us, and there are other phone models out there that have been doing video calling.</p>
<p>Still.  I want one.  Because wouldn&#8217;t you know it, this might be a big deal, this FaceTime that Apple introduced today.  </p>
<p>You have this phone and you can have video chat with people on your phone list.  But wait, what&#8217;s the use of a feature like that if you don&#8217;t have anyone to try it with?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple will ship tens of millions of FaceTime devices this year</p>
<p><em>&#8212; Steve Jobs, today at the WWDC keynote</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tens of millions, eh.  Devices, you say.  Surely not just iPhones.  Camera-equipped iMacs and MacBooks.  iPod Touches in the Fall, maybe?  And the iPad next year?  FaceTime is using Wi-Fi to route the video call after all, but how does it route calls to wifi-only devices if you don&#8217;t sign into a instant messaging network?  <em>UPDATE: Apparently, <a href="http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2010/07/15/exclusive-apples-facetime-coming-to-ipod-touch-ipad-we-detail-how/">using an email address that&#8217;s tied to your Apple ID</a>.</em></p>
<p>The bigger deal, though, is that <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2010/06/what-is-iphone-4s-facetime-video-chat/">Apple is submitting FaceTime&#8217;s recipe of protocols to a standards body</a>, and soon we might see FaceTime running on other phones and devices.  I think that&#8217;s the brilliant part of today&#8217;s story.</p>
