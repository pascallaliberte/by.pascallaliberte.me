<p>This sounds interesting: by 2013, a first fusion engine prototype.</p>

<blockquote>The National Ignition Facility, located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is the world&#8217;s largest laser system&#8230; 192 huge laser beams in a massive building, all focused down at the last moment at a 2 millimeter ball containing frozen hydrogen gas. The goal is to achieve fusion&#8230; getting more energy out than was used to create it. It&#8217;s never been done before under controlled conditions, just in nuclear weapons and in stars. We expect to do it within the next 2-3 years. The purpose is threefold: to create an almost limitless supply of safe, carbon-free, proliferation-free electricity; examine new regimes of astrophysics as well as basic science; and study the inner-workings of the U.S. stockpile of nuclear weapons to ensure they remain safe, secure and reliable without the need for underground testing.</blockquote>
