<p>In 20 years, many variables may change in computing.  Cables will have largely disappeared, the notion that you have to move to a certain location to get access to information will look ridiculous, but one variable won&#8217;t change: the size of the device matters.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll want a personal device that fits in your pocket, which you can hold to your ear for a private conversation with a remote person. You&#8217;ll want something larger that you can consume most of your favourite information on, and even do most of your work on.  And maybe you&#8217;ll have a place where you sit down to work with a device.</p>
<p>But you&#8217;ll still want a device that&#8217;s big enough so you can comfortably sit in front of with friends and family.</p>
<p>All those device sizes will still matter.  You&#8217;ll accomplish largely the same kind of task on each device, but you&#8217;ll accomplish those tasks differently on each.</p>
<blockquote>The new ATV will do away with its current OS X-lite variation as a operating system, and will instead adopt the iPhone OS for the underlying experience. There&#8217;s no word at this point on whether apps and the App Store will be coming along for the ride, but it makes sense given the shared platform. </blockquote>
<p>Seems to me like Apple sees it the same way.</p>
