<blockquote>Enthusiastic, fast, agile, happy</blockquote><p>&#8212; <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2386-support-at-37signals-why-its-awesome">Support at 37signals: Why it&#8217;s awesome - (37signals)</a></p>
<p>Fast is important for good customer service, I knew that already about 37signals&#8217; way of doing things.</p>
<p>Those four things are hard to introduce in a work culture all at once:</p>
<ul><li>Enthusiastic but not Fast?</li>
<li>Fast, but not enthusiastic?</li>
<li>Fast, but not Agile (relunctant)?</li>
<li>Fast, but not Happy?</li>
<li>Agile, but not Happy?</li>
</ul><p>Those are four tough values to adopt.</p>
<p>Taking a page from <a href="http://about.zappos.com/our-unique-culture/zappos-core-values">zappos</a>, I&#8217;m betting the value that makes the others happen is, simply, happiness.</p>
