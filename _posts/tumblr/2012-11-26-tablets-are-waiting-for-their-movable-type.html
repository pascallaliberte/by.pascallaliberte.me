<blockquote>
  <p>Remember the web before Movable Type? If you wanted a blog you had to program one.

  Apps like Marco Arment’s The Magazine give me flashbacks to that time. Wouldn’t it be awesome to publish my own magazine on the iOS Newsstand?
  (&#8230;)
  Now is a great time for another Movable Type. Writers would love a way to push serialized content straight to tablets, and the experience would be a boon to readers.</p>
