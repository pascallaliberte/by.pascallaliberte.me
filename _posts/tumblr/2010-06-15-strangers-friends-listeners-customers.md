> Strangers, Friends, Listeners, Customers, Sneezers, Fans and True Fans. One true fan is worth perhaps 10,000 times as much as a stranger. And yet if you&#8217;re in search of strangers, odds are you&#8217;re going to mistreat a true fan in order to seduce yet another stranger who probably won&#8217;t reward you much.
