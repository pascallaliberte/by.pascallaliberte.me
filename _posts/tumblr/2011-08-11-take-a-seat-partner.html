<p>Boxes. They&#8217;re all over the place in big organizations. This is my box, that&#8217;s your box. Our relationship isn&#8217;t clear enough, let&#8217;s define it. Let&#8217;s make it clear. Let&#8217;s draw some lines. Boxes.</p>
<p>The newcomers, the enthusiastic, the open, the brave, they see these boxes and they don&#8217;t understand. So much red-tape, they say. Boulders to get around. Barriers to go over. Just let us do our job!</p>
<p>Eventually, these brave newcomers either leave or relinquish the battle. And you see their passion die off.</p>
<p><strong>Clarity</strong></p>
<p>John&#8217;s a manager. His team provides services to other sectors in the company. He&#8217;s discerning how to clarify his sector&#8217;s responsibilities (yes, we&#8217;re in the business of this, no we&#8217;re not in that business). He&#8217;s also a believer in community values, in collaboration, and you could tell he found the balance difficult to attain. Not too strict, but not too closed off. Some doors are opened to some, while some doors are better left closed for most.</p>
<p>He wants clear-cut agreements with some people, but he&#8217;d like to engage in more collaborative relationships with some other people, because his team can&#8217;t do all this alone.</p>
<p>In these big organizations, though, you do need agreements. Lines have to be drawn sometimes. Then you just got to give a name to your relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Those are my clients, and these are my partners.</strong></p>
<p>Clients are far. Partners are close.</p>
<p>Clients want more than you can offer, and you close the case at some point. You define the scope. Win-win, for a time. You got more clients to serve.</p>
<p>Partners, though, they help you as much as you help them. There&#8217;s give and take. Win-win, at a deeper level, and for longer. </p>
<p>Partners partly own your problems and you partly own theirs, and that&#8217;s okay because you communicate more openly, and you feed off of each other&#8217;s strengths.</p>
<p>Actually, you feed off of each other&#8217;s enthusiasm, too. And every chance you get to work together, you both feel like newcomers again, and that much more is possible. As if there were no boxes in the first place.</p>
<p>Got enthusiasm and openness? Take a seat, partner.</p>
