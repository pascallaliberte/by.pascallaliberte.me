<p><em>I gave this talk at <a href="http://canheit.uottawa.ca/program/1603926">CANHEIT 2013</a> (Canadian Higher-Ed IT conference) on June 11, 2013. The audience had people from all roles in University IT: from developers to systems analysts to CIOs. I was pretty glad with the turnout and I had a lot of fun giving the talk. Here&#8217;s an abstract:</em></p>

<p>No matter your role in a technology outfit, no matter if you&#8217;re way far from the end-user, what you do is used by a real person. You&#8217;re in the business of making user experiences.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m presenting 7 approaches (pick two) to make your next project more user-centred:</p>

<ul><li>start with the userâ€™s experience </li>
<li>iterate </li>
<li>compare two different takes </li>
<li>watch real people use it </li>
<li>love it! &#8212; disregard the client and build something you&#8217;d use yourself </li>
<li>overlap roles </li>
<li>change the deal</li>
</ul><p>If you&#8217;re a manager or a top executive, you have your own deliverables; use those same approaches to be more user- (worker-) centred.</p>
