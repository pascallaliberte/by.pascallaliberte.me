<p>Do you know the difference between a magnet and a chunk of iron? The magnet has all of its atoms spinning in the same direction.</p>
<p>Changing a culture is hard. You&#8217;ll say you need more people, but maybe there&#8217;s a way to do all the stuff you&#8217;re doing (and more) with the same amount of people.</p>
<p>You want more chunks of iron. I say find a way to change the iron you have into a magnet.</p>
