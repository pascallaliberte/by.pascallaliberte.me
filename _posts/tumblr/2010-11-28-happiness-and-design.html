<p>Gave a talk on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/pascallaliberte/happiness-and-design-5974677">Happiness and Design</a> at UXCamp Ottawa, on November 27th 2010.</p>
<p>The best predictor of great design isn&#8217;t the tips nor the tactics nor the tools, but rather, it comes from your own happiness.  This presentation identifies the forces between happiness and design, and how in the end, the process of becoming happy is the same as creating great design for the end-user.</p>
<p>More pragmatically, design isn&#8217;t the only preoccupation on the mind of the typical user experience designer: changing the culture of the organization most often is the prime barrier to great design.  Happy, win-win people are the ones who usually lead lasting culture changes.</p>
<p>Design your life, spread your own delight.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Re-uploaded the presentation to save a few transition clicks, and corrected the order of the slides.</p>
