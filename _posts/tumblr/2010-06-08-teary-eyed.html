<p><a href="http://blog.pascallaliberte.info/2010-06-apple-wwdc-2010-keynote-address/">Following up on my post from early today</a>, something’s not sitting right with the keynote for me.  Steve Jobs was a little too melancholic yesterday, giving his thanks to everyone on the team, making a big deal with the finally-we-got-it-working video phone.</p>
<p>It’s been a tough year for him, to be sure, avoiding death and all.  But look at the keynote with the perspective that 3 months from now, we learn that he will no longer be running the company. See how it feels as though he&#8217;s giving this keynote as though it may be his last one?</p>
<p>It would be a perfect ending.  He&#8217;s going to be credited a lot of things, and not the least of which, two form factors that will have revolutionized mobile communication devices and computing through the iPhone and the iPad and now, realizing a childhood dream of his, to bring video calling to reality.  He could stop here and he could make this keynote his last one and he would be leaving on a high note.  And looking in hindsight a few months or years from now you could say I told you so.</p>
<p>We already know that Steve <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html">lives each day as if it were his last one</a>, but that didn&#8217;t stop him from delivering all his keynotes on the assumption he&#8217;d continue running the ship for longer.  I&#8217;m sensing, this time, that he&#8217;s sending a subtle look-at-my-life&#8217;s-contribution message and a subtler I&#8217;m-passing-the-torch moment at the end.</p>
<p>But who am I kidding.  Steve&#8217;s not going anywhere.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
