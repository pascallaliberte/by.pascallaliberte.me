<p>In your company, you&#8217;re asked to ship this new thing. You&#8217;ve got a fixed amount of time, a fixed amount of manpower, and a fixed amount of money. It can be either done well or done on time or done on budget. Pick two. But why? Why not pick all three?</p>

<p>You come at a disagreement with a teammate. You have differing opinions about creating this new thing. Do it like I think or do it like he thinks. But why does it have to be one or the other?</p>

<p>In both of these cases, there seems to be a scarcity problem. There seem to be constraints that are picking a fight with your options. There are tensions, opposing ideas, ends of a spectrum.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s either this or it&#8217;s that. It can&#8217;t be both.</p>

<p>Really? It can&#8217;t be both? Only, there&#8217;s Apple who can ship high quality in high quantities before everybody else. Only, there are parents who have 6 kids and they all grow up to be well-rounded champions. Only, there are leaders who unfold more productivity out of smaller teams. So surely, some people don&#8217;t have a problem with the word &#8216;both&#8217;.</p>

<p>So how do they do it? How do they get to do what others can&#8217;t do? They&#8217;ve learned something that others don&#8217;t know yet:</p>

<p>There is no conflict. There is no &#8216;either&#8217;. They&#8217;ve learned to catch themselves putting in an &#8216;or&#8217; where they can simply change that &#8216;or&#8217; to an &#8216;and&#8217;: high quality <em>and</em> high quantity; he&#8217;s got it right <em>and</em> I&#8217;ve got it right.</p>

<p>They&#8217;ve learned to see the problem from an entirely new angle. They stop looking at it from the angle everybody else looks at it from and they <em>invent</em>, in their mind, a new angle to see things from. They make up an entirely new possibility. They just don&#8217;t give into the trap of the &#8216;either&#8217; and the &#8216;or&#8217;, the trap that creates conflict where none is required.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s how you can do it too:</p>

<p>Next time you feel conflicted between two options, ask yourself if you&#8217;re seeing things with an &#8216;or&#8217; (this <em>or</em> that). If you are, rephrase that conflict in your head by asking yourself: &#8220;Is there any way that we can achieve this <em>and</em> that, that we can do both?&#8221;</p>

<p>Maybe you&#8217;ll be able to find a new approach you hadn&#8217;t thought about when you were sure there was a conflict. Maybe there&#8217;s a way for you to step out of the apparent conflict and notice that there&#8217;s a constructive third option, right there, at arm&#8217;s reach. Maybe you&#8217;ll find your relationships to be richer, more mutually beneficial, more engaging, and longer lasting.</p>

<p>"Both", "and": those aren&#8217;t just words that are the key to doing great things. They&#8217;re also the key to getting yourself out of seemingly conflicting situations. That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re not only an important part of how excellent people, teams, families operate, they&#8217;re an important part of how adaptable, agile and always renewed people, teams and families operate.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s just a different way of thinking.</p>
