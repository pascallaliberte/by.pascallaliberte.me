<p>This is a great time to be building apps.</p>
<p>You can get your app on a <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/">store-front</a> and tons of people can buy your app without thinking twice about it. Customers can find you, and your fans can spread the word for you. Your app is findable and spreadable. Your product will sell on its merits. That kind of market favours the smart, human-connected and small over the slow, impersonal and large.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in it for the long-term and you iterate your app, you can build a nice business. You can be like that baker on the street corner. People will drop by, you&#8217;ll know their favourite kind of loaf. You&#8217;ll chat up and they&#8217;ll take an extra pastry or two before they go. You can be the baker by hanging out at the virtual storefront: respond to people on twitter, answer comments on your blog, chat up your <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/05/the-circles-no-more-strangers.html">true fans</a> and fold into your apps the stuff you both like. You&#8217;re building your business <em>with</em> your customers. There&#8217;s a relationship. People value what you do, and you value your people.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re close to your people, but you&#8217;re also close to yourself and your craft. There are many places you can take your app, but you know what you like and what you don&#8217;t like. You developed a sort of palate for how your app is designed. You&#8217;re not solving every problem, you&#8217;re only solving the stuff that you care for. You can let others figure out how to make apps solve other problems, because there&#8217;s plenty of space for all sorts of apps, like there&#8217;s plenty of space for another baker in town. You got your breads, the other baker specializes in different breads.</p>
<p>In fact, your app can solve a pretty specific problem, because the app market is a lot larger than a village. Your app is findable and spreadable, and so you can focus on a pretty slim slice of customers. You want a way to track your personal journal, but you don&#8217;t like the experience of using the other competitors? <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Build your own</a>. Yours will be just the way you like it. It&#8217;ll be easy to use for the tasks you do most. It&#8217;ll be a delight to use for the types of journal entries you like to write up. You&#8217;ll make all these small design choices, suited to your own taste and to your own palate, and chances are tons of people will be craving the same qualities. You&#8217;re into crusty sourdough with lots of big bubbles. So is someone else. And both of you can connect in a seller-client relationship like never before.</p>
<p>Used to be that apps were tough to sell, and so companies who sold software needed to be big and well structured. The software needed to hit the middle of the road to be successful. The apps were built for the lowest common denominator, because that was the only way to get noticed, to get the right kind of volume to make some revenue. The apps needed to be incredibly clever, and companies valued engineering prowesses over delightful user experiences.</p>
<p>No more. You don&#8217;t need a big company or complicated algorithms to create a product that creates a difference, an app that is remarkable. You can count on just solving small annoyances, delighting people with a <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper">simple app that does a few things remarkably well</a>, and in a different way than anyone else.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a hyper-niche-user-experience market.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a new kind of App market.</p>
