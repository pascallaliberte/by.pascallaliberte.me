<p>Hello.  You&#8217;ve reached the end of my blog.</p>
<p>This is my first post, and I&#8217;m a bit awkward writing it.  Most people use the first post to describe what they intend to do with it, what it&#8217;s going to be about, and although I&#8217;d like to have that kind of assurance and vision, I&#8217;m probably better off not making any of those sorts of predictions.</p>
<p>When you meet someone in the real world, you start by saying who you are, where you&#8217;re from, what you do for a living, but on a blog, it doesn&#8217;t work like that.  Your first impression is the last post you wrote, the title of the blog, and the description you gave for it.  The first post is usually the last one being read, except for the first few visitors.  (Hi!)</p>
<p><b>Shclick</b></p>
<p>When this blog will have aged a few years, quite a few things will have changed about it.  For the sake of posterity, I&#8217;m recording here an image of the first version.</p>

<p><b>Title:</b> I eat URLs for breakfast (<i>Ed</i> &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/pascallaliberte/status/6083547255">it&#8217;s complicated</a>)</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> Pascal Laliberté lives in Ottawa, Canada. He created this blog to escape the important things he had to do that day, which included reviewing web content, preparing for a presentation, and saving the world.</p>
<p><b>Most people had a first one, too.</b><br/>I thought it&#8217;d be interesting to link to the first posts of a few blogs I read. For now.</p>
