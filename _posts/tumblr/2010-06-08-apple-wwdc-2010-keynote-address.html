<p>Just watched the Apple WWDC keynote.  What struck me wasn&#8217;t so much the new stuff Steve presented, but that he wanted the audience to come out of it teary eyed.</p>
<p>"This is our new baby", the FaceTime demo from the couch, the Louis Armstrong song at the end.  People came in expecting new hardware, but he wanted people to leave with a sense of melancholy.  Of course, all of these are calculated marketing messages, from the wide-smiles on Jony Ive&#8217;s FaceTime shot to the way he drew participation from the public asking "How do you like it so far".  It&#8217;s all intentional.</p>
