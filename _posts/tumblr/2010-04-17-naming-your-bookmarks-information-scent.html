<p>At Web Directions North 2007, <a href="http://twitter.com/JMSPOOL">Jared Spool</a> held a workshop on usability where he talked about the importance of how you name stuff on your page.  How you name your links, your calls to action: that all matters.  You&#8217;ve got to name them with what he calls &#8220;Information Scent&#8221;; the link must suck the attention of the user towards itself.  You must name the link what the user is looking for.</p>
<p>The user enters a page with a specific word or phrase in mind.  Jared calls that the &#8220;<a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/trigger_words/">trigger word</a>" (<a href="http://www.gerrymcgovern.com/">Gerry McGovern</a> calls them &#8221;<a href="http://www.customercarewords.com/">carewords</a>&#8221;).  Designing an easy to use web page has that principle at its core: use the user&#8217;s trigger word in a link, a button, a call to action, a navigation item.</p>
<p><strong>Browser bookmarks as navigation</strong></p>
<p>While I was never a big fan of the usability of the bookmarks menu and the different ways you get to your bookmarks, I&#8217;m a huge fan of the bookmarks bar.  It&#8217;s a navigation menu, one that I create myself.  It exposes the bookmarks in my peripheral view - no need for digging in menus.  I chose the words for each item of this menu (all except one which I&#8217;ll correct below) to work for me and my mental model.</p>

<p><strong>Trigger word</strong></p>
<p>I open my browser with a task in mind.  And the task is usually a word or phrase (although sometimes it&#8217;s a picture or a relative location the item on the page).  This word occupies my mental space while I look at my bookmark bar.</p>
<p>Take this example.  I want to get into <a href="http://highrisehq.com/">Highrise</a>, <a href="http://37signals.com/">37signal</a>'s contact manager app.  My trigger word - the word I have in mind when looking at the page - is &#8220;Highrise&#8221;.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a problem.  The bookmark isn&#8217;t named &#8220;Highrise&#8221;.  By default, it&#8217;s named &#8220;37signals Launchpad&#8221; (I know you&#8217;re not stuck linking to their launchpad, but stick with me for a second).</p>
<p><strong><img src="/d/2010/naming-your-bookmarks-information-scent-02.png"/></strong></p>
<p>I want to keep the ability to have that link open the launchpad, because let&#8217;s say I have several Highrise and Basecamp accounts, and the launchpad still has value for me.</p>
<p>However, that bookmark&#8217;s name doesn&#8217;t mean anything to me.  I scan the bookmarks menu looking for the word &#8220;Highrise&#8221;, but I can&#8217;t find it at first glance.  I then look at each item individually (or in the relative location where I expect the bookmark to be found) and I ask the question in mind: &#8220;Is this it?  Will it bring me to Highrise? No.  Next.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Renaming your bookmark</strong></p>
<p>I could just call the bookmark &#8220;Highrise&#8221;, but I use the same link to get to <a href="http://basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a> as well.</p>
<p>Is there a common name that encompasses both names?  <strong>37signals</strong>?  Not close enough for me.  <strong>Productivity</strong>?  Sounds like a silly choice, but isn&#8217;t this the process we go through when choosing how to group elements together under a category name in a navigation menu?  Common pitfall.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t there be another way to have Highrise and Basecamp both represented under the same bookmark?  How about &#8220;<strong>Highrise, Basecamp</strong>&#8221;:</p>
<p><strong><span><img src="/d/2010/naming-your-bookmarks-information-scent-03.png"/></span></strong></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter that the comma and the space make the two words look like there are two different items.  All that matters is that I see the word &#8220;Highrise&#8221; when scanning the navigation list, and that when I click on it, I have a <strong>high confidence</strong> that it will take me where I need to go.  </p>
<p>The link has strong &#8220;<a href="http://www.uie.com/reports/scent_of_information/">Information Scent</a>&#8221;.  It <em>draws me</em> into a high-confidence click.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s not the user&#8217;s fault</strong></p>
<p>The link titled &#8220;37signals Launchpad&#8221; <em><a href="http://www.sensible.com/dmmt.html">made me think</a></em> twice before clicking on it.  &#8221;Productivity&#8221; would have made me think too.  They both make me <strong>pause, interpret, second guess, compare</strong> the link with other links on the rest of the page or in the menu.  They make me feel as though I&#8217;m a poor computer user, that what I&#8217;m looking for is an exception to the rule.  That I don&#8217;t have the right word in mind.</p>
<p>When you choose a name of that next bookmark you save, think about those words you use on your site.  Think about the user&#8217;s point of view, their trigger words.  Then rename your links.</p>
