<p>Learning something new is tough. All the variables are new, the vocabulary is new, the techniques are new. Most people who are already in-the-know on that thing you&#8217;re learning, they think all of those things you&#8217;re learning are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DunningKruger_effect">obvious, no big deal, instinctive</a>. But for you, you&#8217;re out in left field, and you feel it.</p>
<p>I joined a for-fun basketball league recently. It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve played in a team since high school, and the first time I&#8217;ve played with an English-speaking team. And I&#8217;m lost. I&#8217;m lost in the plays you need to do, I&#8217;m not sure where I need to be, and I have no idea what the coach is talking about. Before joining the league I didn&#8217;t know that I didn&#8217;t know, and now I <em>know</em> that I don&#8217;t know. And I&#8217;m navigating through the mountain of new variables, guessing my way through them and picking the low-hanging fruit.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of ways to get better at something, and all the options revolve around a word: investing. You can invest time in practicing, you can invest in broadening your perspective by reading up on how other people do it, you can invest in books, videos, tutorials, personal coaching, therapy, and of course, investing in a teacher. You can invest time, you can invest money, but either way you&#8217;re investing something that&#8217;ll cost you some other opportunity.</p>
<p>All those examples are extrinsic investments &#8212; you invest in stuff that&#8217;s outside of you, and you consume the outside investment to make it part of you. You&#8217;re investing in something that you don&#8217;t have, you get help from outside. The thing you learn then becomes part of you, within you.</p>
<p>When you look at it that way, you realize you are receiving knowledge, and you have control over how you receive it too.  Your stance, how your mind is positioned to receive your new knowledge, that&#8217;s what separates the active learner from the passive learner. It&#8217;s what distinguishes someone who learns fast and deep from someone who scratches the surface.</p>
<p>Paying for courses, spending your lunchtime watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TiZOBHYhig">tutorials on youtube</a>, reading up on the <a href="http://www.nba.com/canada/Basketball_U_on_Hoops_Lingo-Canada_Generic_Article-18055.html">basketball lingo</a> before the game, those are all ways to invest time or money in learning.</p>
<p>But above all, the best investment you can make when you learn is simply to <em>pay attention</em>. It costs almost nothing. The work you need to do is all in the head, it means removing  everything else within you that&#8217;s distracting you from learning, and it costs just a second of your time to switch those gears. It&#8217;s being present, in the moment, with the game, with the teacher, with the person in front of you, with the subject matter.</p>
<p>Sure, spend time or money to learn. But make the choice to pay attention, and receive that new knowledge. It&#8217;ll multiply your investment.</p>
