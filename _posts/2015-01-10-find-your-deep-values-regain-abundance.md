Recently, I've felt stuck. Although things were on the upswing in my personal life, I saw my professional options becoming scarce. I had big stuff in mind for the long-term, but from my perspective no immediate next step stood out as being really great. So I decided to look up the literature of companies I thought made good decisions.

In the circles of design agencies, Teehan+Lax was on the rise. They've been winning over some big clients and they were on a prosperous streak. And yet, some long-time team members were starting to leave. How can things go that well if your best people are quitting the company? It turns out, they were leaving because [they felt Teehan+Lax no longer stood for anything][teehanlax].

Teehan+Lax turned to some friends for help to fix their employee attrition problem. They were recommended the exercise called *Mountains and Valleys*, which helps you find your deep values. So I followed it too, and here's how it works.

## The exercise

![Mountains, valleys, good and bad]({{ site.base_url }}/d/2015/find-your-deep-values-regain-abundance.png)

The [Mountains and Valleys exercise][exercise] makes you list the most significant moments in your life, the ones that stand out as influential -- good or bad. From each moment -- from each *episode* of your life -- you draw a list of values that were present (represented) and values that were missing (threatened). You'll get a long list of values that you can add to and edit down to your core, deep values.

I chose to go further with the exercise and listed sub-values and counter-values. Sub-values added other words to get a clearer picture of what each value meant for me. Counter-values were the opposite words, the things I stood against.

It felt great to pin down that list -- freeing! It made me understand why I felt so alienated in the bottom of those valleys (the worst moments), and why I felt such abundance at the top of those mountains (the best moments).

And over the months after finding that list, it became clear that I suddenly had new options, that I could steer the elements of my life back to new heights.

## Steering to abundance

It became fun to check each part of my life for a values fit.

Regarding relationships, I had already done the exercise of figuring out [my inner circle and my outer circle][circles], so I checked each person to see where we matched, and where we diverged; who exercised values in common with me and who exercised my counter-values.

Whoa! Some of my friends exhibit some of my counter-values! What's the deal? Why am I actively entertaining these relations? The thought of cutting them off came up, but that felt childish to me; I knew there were mature ways to renegotiate expectations. So I set off to start the process and have those important discussions.

Then I looked at the activities and events I take part in, and was surprised at how they fit my values. I spend a lot of time in faith-community-type events and it just seemed a no-brainer why I did.

Then there was my place of employment. It hit me that my values were scarcely represented there, and yet they were, with a few keen folks, whom I naturally sought and connected with over the years. It's no wonder I've been fascinated with cultural change! Still, this was a big realization.

So knowing all this, I'm seeking out the activities, places and people that are a better fit, and that gives me some new options to regain abundance.

But that's not all I'm doing. I'm now starting to intentionally speak my newfound values -- wear them, live them -- since abundance is better shared than kept for oneself.

So here's the [link to the exercise][exercise]. If you want to do a thorough job, it should take you a few weeks to go through it and make tweaks until something great comes out. Have fun!
