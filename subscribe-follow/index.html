    <p>This blog is about what it means to aim for two things at once: leading a modern life, with all its nuances and its adjustments, and seeking to live out the Gospel, the challenging and beautiful way that Jesus Christ proposes.</p>
    <p>Maybe you're into to the Gospel but you have trouble being in touch with the modern world.</p>
    <p>Maybe you recognize that modernity has better answers and yet you're intrigued by modern Christian models who live out their faith with integrity.</p>
    <p>Maybe you've been living both of these for a while and you'd like to connect with others that live the same way.</p>
    <p>If so, you might be interested in the articles from this blog. I publish an article every few months.<p>
